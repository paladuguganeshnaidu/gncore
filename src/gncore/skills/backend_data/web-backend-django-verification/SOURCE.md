Revision: `25278e7d7b6cf6e6a4e7a6c8e10f14ff22f0eb5b`.

Upstream metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "django-verification",
  "description": "Run the full Django verification loop — environment check, mypy/ruff/black linting, migration safety, pytest with coverage targets, pip-audit and bandit security scans, settings and logging review, and diff review — producing a phased pass/fail report before release or PR. Use when preparing a Django pull request, validating migrations or coverage, or running pre-deploy readiness checks.",
  "metadata": {
    "origin": "ECC"
  }
}
```

Modifications: GNCore name and focused entrypoint, progressive reference loading, portable path guidance, and host-neutral execution scope. The source entrypoint is retained as `UPSTREAM.md`; nested source entrypoints use the same reference filename to avoid installing unintended skills. Explicitly linked sibling resources are retained under `upstream-support/` and mapped in `RESOURCE_PATHS.json` when needed.

Upstream notice origins: LICENSE. Notices are retained in `notices/` and in their original locations inside copied skill folders where supplied. Frontmatter declarations can differ from repository-level notices; both are retained.

Attribution and license: See retained upstream notices and metadata. Original authors retain authorship of their contributions.
