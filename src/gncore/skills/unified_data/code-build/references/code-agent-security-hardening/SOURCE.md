Modifications: GNCore name and focused entrypoint, progressive reference loading, portable path guidance, and host-neutral execution scope. The source entrypoint is retained as `UPSTREAM.md`; nested source entrypoints use the same reference filename to avoid installing unintended skills. Explicitly linked sibling resources are retained under `upstream-support/` and mapped in `RESOURCE_PATHS.json` when needed.

Upstream notice origins: LICENSE. Notices are retained in `notices/` and in their original locations inside copied skill folders where supplied. Frontmatter declarations can differ from repository-level notices; both are retained.

Attribution and license: See retained upstream notices and metadata. Original authors retain authorship of their contributions.
