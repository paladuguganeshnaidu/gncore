GNCore adaptation of [mattpocock/skills / to-spec](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/blob/59db609eb1e18aaf59b63284d0e52255aff0c63c/skills/engineering/to-spec/SKILL.md).

Revision: `59db609eb1e18aaf59b63284d0e52255aff0c63c`.

Upstream metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "to-spec",
  "description": "Turn the current conversation into a spec and publish it to the project issue tracker: no interview, just synthesis of what you've already discussed.",
  "disable-model-invocation": true
}
```

Modifications: GNCore name and focused entrypoint, progressive reference loading, portable path guidance, and host-neutral execution scope. The source entrypoint is retained as `UPSTREAM.md`; nested source entrypoints use the same reference filename to avoid installing unintended skills. Explicitly linked sibling resources are retained under `upstream-support/` and mapped in `RESOURCE_PATHS.json` when needed.

Upstream notice origins: LICENSE. Notices are retained in `notices/` and in their original locations inside copied skill folders where supplied. Frontmatter declarations can differ from repository-level notices; both are retained.

Attribution and license: See retained upstream notices and metadata. Original authors retain authorship of their contributions. Trail of Bits adaptations, including the GNCore entrypoint, are distributed under CC BY-SA 4.0, with attribution and modification disclosure; GNCore's MIT code license does not relicense these materials.
