Upstream metadata:

  "name": "redis-core",
  "description": "Core Redis modeling guidance — choose the right data structure (String, Hash, List, Set, Sorted Set, JSON, Stream, Vector Set) and use consistent colon-separated key names. Use when designing a Redis data model, caching objects, deciding between Hash and JSON, building counters, leaderboards, membership sets, or session stores, or when reviewing/cleaning up Redis key naming.",

Modifications: GNCore name and focused entrypoint, progressive reference loading, portable path guidance, and host-neutral execution scope. The source entrypoint is retained as `UPSTREAM.md`; nested source entrypoints use the same reference filename to avoid installing unintended skills. Explicitly linked sibling resources are retained under `upstream-support/` and mapped in `RESOURCE_PATHS.json` when needed.

Upstream notice origins: LICENSE. Notices are retained in `notices/` and in their original locations inside copied skill folders where supplied. Frontmatter declarations can differ from repository-level notices; both are retained.

Attribution and license: See retained upstream notices and metadata. Original authors retain authorship of their contributions.
