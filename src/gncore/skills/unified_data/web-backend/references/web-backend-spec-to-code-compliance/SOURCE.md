Revision: `bf23bfb21f10a2a4b0406086d690dc8cb1b3ccf3`.

Upstream metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "spec-to-code-compliance",
  "description": "Check code against the documentation that specifies it - which requirements hold, which the code contradicts, which are absent, and what the code does that no document mentions. Use when comparing an implementation against a whitepaper, protocol spec, or design document.",
  "allowed-tools": "Workflow Task Read Grep Glob"
}
```

Modifications: GNCore name and focused entrypoint, progressive reference loading, portable path guidance, and host-neutral execution scope. The source entrypoint is retained as `UPSTREAM.md`; nested source entrypoints use the same reference filename to avoid installing unintended skills. Explicitly linked sibling resources are retained under `upstream-support/` and mapped in `RESOURCE_PATHS.json` when needed.

Upstream notice origins: LICENSE. Notices are retained in `notices/` and in their original locations inside copied skill folders where supplied. Frontmatter declarations can differ from repository-level notices; both are retained.

Attribution and license: CC-BY-SA-4.0. Original authors retain authorship of their contributions. Trail of Bits adaptations, including the GNCore entrypoint, are distributed under CC BY-SA 4.0, with attribution and modification disclosure; GNCore's MIT code license does not relicense these materials.
